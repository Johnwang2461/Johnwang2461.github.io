I am completing my Ph.D. in Education Policy at the University of Virginia. My research focuses on unpacking how our educational systems equitably develops students' higher-order thinking skills (critical thinking, analytical reasoning, and problem solving abilities), an increasingly important set of skills for individuals' long-term college, career, and civic success. I leverage cutting-edge computational approaches (e.g., large language models or web scraping) to construct novel datasets as well as econometric and psychometric techniques to rigorously examine higher-order thinking skills at scale. My work has been supported by the Urban Institute's Student Upward Mobility Initative, the Virginia Education Sciences Training Pre-Doctoral Fellowship, and the Bankard Fund for Political Economy Pre-Doctoral Fellowship.
